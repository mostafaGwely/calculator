first of all you should setup the library (pyqt4 and pygraphviz)
here is the instructions 
$sudo pip install python-pyqt4
$sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
$sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv
$sudo  pip install pygraphviz
$sudo pip install image
###################################################

there a 3 algorithms in this progject to calculate the infix expresion 

1- using postfix expresion >>>> the file of that algorithm named "postfix.py"
2- usind tree(by insert parentheses to th infix expresion)  >>>> the file of that algorithm named "parentheses.py"
3- using tree(by insertion method )   >>>> the file of that algorithm named "postfixtree.py"

####################
TO RUN THE PROJECT :
  run the file named "window.py"
##################
the file "New.py" is for printing the tree from infix .
the file "main.py" and "design3" is the design approved by pyqtdesiner
